# VRLink Frontend React Native Developer Test Task

This project was bootstrapped with yarn's [create-expo-app](https://reactnative.dev/docs/typescript) using the TypeScript & navigation template.

## Your task

VRLink has an [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) server that you can make GraphQL calls to. This project is initialized with GraphQL and it is your responsibility to use GraphQL to get the data for VRLink Customers and Products.

You will create two tabs, one for Customers and one for Products.

The Customers tab will display a list of VRLink customers, When tapping on a customer, it should go to a new page that displays info about the customer.

The Products tab will display VRLink products. Each product should show the photo, the style code, and color code. When tapping on the product, the product should become "selected" with a visible indication that it has been selected. At the top, you should be able to see how many products have been selected.

Both tabs should have their icons changed to represent what the screen is showing.
